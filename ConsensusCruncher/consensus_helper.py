#
# Author: Nina Wang
# Date Created: Mar 24, 2016
###############################################################
# Function:
# Helper functions for single strand and duplex consensus making.
#
# Written for Python 3.5.1
#
# Concepts:
#   - Unique tag: identifier for grouping PCR duplicates from the same read of a strand of a molecule
#   - Consensus tag: new query name to pair consensus tags (R1 and R2 from the same strand of a molecule)
#                    Each consensus tag corresponds to 2 unique tags

        both for easy duplex tag search (if we didn't track both, you'd have to look for the corresponding mate cigar
        each time)
